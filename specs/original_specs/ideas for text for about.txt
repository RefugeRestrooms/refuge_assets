Text for use in the Application About

Every bathroom listed in our database are what we consider to be a "refuge" for transgender, intersex, and other gender nonconforming individuals to use the restroom. Please note that our database is user generated and this may not always be the case. While some restrooms may not be "unisex" they are still safe to use (in comparision with others) - ie. the restrooms at the SF LGBT center. 

Restrooms listings are filterable by restrooms that are truely unisex / genderfree and by ada acessibility. This is to help provide the best possible restroom suggestions to our users.
